      "After the pandemic hit in 2020 I had to leave China, so I decided to go to Taipei to continue studying Chinese! After 4 months at a Chinese Language School, I found I really enjoyed living in Taiwan, so decided to become an English Teacher. I quickly found a job at a cram school and taught English there for 8 months while continuing my Chinese studies with a tutor and langauge exhcange partners!",

Unfortunately I was only there for 1 month, but I met some amazing people who would become really good friends. One of my favorite things about Shanghai is the 小笼包 'xiaolongbao' which is a very yummy dumpling filled with soup and generally pork.",

One thing I really enjoyed about Poland was the cats! There were so many cats outside just hanging out. ",

It was probably one of the best decisions I have ever made since I met my best friend there! Other than that, I spent around 6 months studying TaiChi and going on small trips around China.",
